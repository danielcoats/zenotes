Clean, distraction-free notes for Chrome. [Install it here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenotes/fphoofpcklpbccekhlcmhagpbddbkfdp?authuser=1).

This is a test Chrome extension I made to be able to store my notes somewhere. Is is heavily inspired by apps like [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/).

Built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It is using `chrome.storage.sync` API to store data (which means the data is synced between all devices).
